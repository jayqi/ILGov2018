## Welcome!
This is the git home for the project to catalog and visualize contributions to 
candidates in the Illinois 2018 governor's race.

### Organizers
- Stephanie Kirmer
- Lilian Huang 
- Andy Moon

### How to get involved
Join us on this repo, on data.world, and/or join us at ChiHackNight in Chicago on
Tuesday evenings. 

### Tasks We Are Working On
- Extract the data from https://www.illinoissunshine.org/api-documentation/
- Figure out what other data needs to be downloaded for context (e.g. donors' industries, etc)
- Collect that additional data and join to the donations data
- Build a Shiny app infrastructure to visualize the data
- Maintain and update the visualization through the election in November 2018
